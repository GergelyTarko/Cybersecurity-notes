# Kerberos
**Port: 88**

Kerberos  is a computer-network authentication protocol that works on the basis of _tickets_ to allow nodes communicating over a non-secure network to prove their identity to one another in a secure manner.
Kerberos is an authentication protocol, not authorization. In other words, it allows to identify each user, who provides a secret password, however, it does not validates to which resources or services can this user access.
Kerberos is used in [Active Directory](./Active-Directory).
